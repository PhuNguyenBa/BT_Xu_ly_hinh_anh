This is the exercise Develop a Python application that leverages multithreading to accelerate the classification of a large image dataset. Incorporate a pre-trained image recognition model from Teachable Machine into your code, ensuring efficient parallel processing for optimal performance.
I have uploaded the source file and dataset about image. But there are too many image files so I will leave the link of the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aksha05/flower-image-dataset/data
